            Hey! My name is [NAME] and I study Computer Science at Brown University. 
            I am currently a junior and I have experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, 
            and React.js for frontend development. My recent projects include a user
            experience study for a physical interface, a responsive website, a larger
            scale group project to practice iterating on design ideas, and an interactive
            sorting and filtering website built in React.js. These projects follow my 
            personal development as a designer. In chronological order, they build from
            the fundamentals of a physical user interface and up to incorporating more
            and more engineering to bring the websites to life. 
        </p>

            The process of design is very rewarding for me. I think there needs to be 
            consideration of a variety of potential users at every step in the design
            process. From initial sketches to wireframes, lofi and highfi prototypes, 
            and finally to the actual coded website, it is important to think about what
            different users would want from the product and be agile in its development.
